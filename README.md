The solution of the given problem of Zennode
It is a simple JavaScript application for calculating the total cost of a shopping cart, taking into account various factors such as product prices, quantities, gift wrapping fees, shipping fees, and applicable discounts. To use the program, follow these steps:

    Define Product Prices:
        Edit the productPrices object in the main function to specify the prices for each product.

    Set Additional Fees:
        Adjust the giftWrapFee and shippingFeePerPackage variables in the main function to reflect the desired fees for gift wrapping and shipping.

    Run the Program:
        Execute the main function by calling main() at the end of the script. If you're running this in a browser, you might want to use a tool like the browser console to execute the code.

    Enter Product Quantities:
        For each product, the program prompts you to enter the quantity and whether it should be gift-wrapped. Respond to these prompts accordingly.

    Review Output:
        After entering the quantities for each product, the program will display details such as subtotal, applied discount, shipping fee, and the total cost.

Here's a summary of the output:

    Product Details: Displays the quantity of each product and its total cost.
    Subtotal: Total cost of products without discounts or fees.
    Discount Applied: Type of discount applied and the corresponding amount.
    Shipping Fee: Fee for shipping based on the number of packages.
    Total: Final cost including discounts and shipping fees.

    Check the Console:
        If you are running this in a browser, open the browser console to see the output.

Note: The program uses the prompt function, which is suitable for interactive use in a console or browser environment. If you are running this in a non-interactive environment, you may need to modify the input gathering mechanism to suit your needs.
